This course provides students with a broad understanding of modern software engineering. Although it will cover theory, the emphasis is on providing practical skills in software engineering currently used in industry. To that end, it will cover project and product management, software architecture and design patterns, team communications, and other material relevant to __engineering__ software instead of just __coding__ it.

## Grading

  * Mid-term Exam 1 - 15%
  * Mid-term Exam 2 - 15%
  * Group Project:
    * Sprint 1 Deliverable - 10%
    * Sprint 2 Deliverable - 10% 
    * Sprint 3 Deliverable - 10%
    * Sprint 4 Deliverable - 10%
    * Sprint 5 Deliverable - 10%
    * Final Deliverable and Presentation - 15%
  * Class Participation - 5% (Exercises and Guest Lecture attendance)

It is strongly recommended that you come to class each for each lecture.  Material may be presented or covered in class that is not in the reading.  I also expect active participation in class (there will be various projects done in class).  However,  I will only take roll for the class exercise days.  On these days, attendance and participation is mandatory.

The syllabus is subject to modification if circumstances dictate (e.g. a guest lecturer is unable to make the scheduled day).

The following grading scale will be used.

Score  | Grade
-----: | ------------------------------
100.00-94.00 | A (A+ for extraordinary work)
93.99-91.00  | A-
90.99-88.00  | B+
87.99-84.00  | B
83.99-81.00  | B-
80.99-78.00  | C+
77.99-74.00  | C
73.99-71.00  | C-
70.99-68.00  | D+
67.99-64.00  | D
63.99-61.00  | D-
60.99-0.00   | F

All groups are expected to do their own work on the group project, but are more than welcome to collaborate and ask questions with other groups, the Internet, or other colleagues.  Projects may be analyzed with the Stanford _moss_ system to detect unauthorized collaboration between groups.

However, any student caught collaborating or cheating on an exam will automatically receive a 0 (zero) for that exam, and may be penalized more harshly based on University of Pittsburgh academic policy.

Note that there are two mid-terms, and no final exams.  The second mid-term exam will not be cumulative.

It is recommended you keep all of your graded assignments until final grades are posted and accepted, in order to resolve any discrepancies in grading.

## Readings

Readings are listed in the syllabus.md file for each day.  The instructor may not mention the reading for the next class.  The onus is on you to review the syllabus and do the appropriate reading before class.

## Attendance

Presence for the mid-term exams and class exercises are REQUIRED.  They will be individually re-scheduled only in the event of an emergency.  If you are facing an emergency, please contact the instructor IMMEDIATELY (if it is safe to do so, of course).  Failure to show up for an exam without clearing it first with the instructor will result in a 0 (zero) for that exam or exercise.

## Group Project Details

Students will be grouped into groups of approximately 4 or 5, and will work on a project for the duration of the course.  There will be several sprints, at the end of each of which the students will have a working version of their software available on GitHub or GitLab, as well as documentation and other information (specified for each particular sprint).

Deliverables must be committed to GitHub or GitLab by the beginning of class on the day that it is due.  Late deliverables will NOT be accepted unless authorized __at least 24 hours before the due date__.

## Extra Credit

Bonus points (at the discretion of the instructor) will be given if you give a talk to a programming meetup, the Pitt Computer Science club, or a conference.

If you are looking to do this, I recommend you start early to prepare a talk and set up a time with the organization.

I do not give retroactive or other extra credit.  If you are interested in extra credit, here is your opportunity!

## Programming Language Selection

All software projects for this course will be written in the Java language (version 1.8).  Additionally, we will be using associated tools, libraries and frameworks such as Swing, Gradle and JUnit.  These will be discussed in class.

## Collaborative Programming

Note that all works produced by you are your intellectual property and you may do what you want with it.  However, this class is collaborative.  You may need to show and share your work to other students under the direction of the instructor.

## Disability Services Statement

"The Office of Disability Resources and
Services (DRS) provides a broad range of support services to assist
students with disabilities. Services include, but are not limited to,
tape-recorded textbooks, sign language interpreters, adaptive and
transportation. Contact DRS at 412-648-7890 or 412-383-1355 (TTY) in
216 William Pitt Union or see www.drs.pitt.edu for more computer
technology, Braille translation, and nonstandard exam arrangements,
DRS can also assist students with accessibility to campus housing
information."

## Academic Integrity Statement

"As members of the University of
Pittsburgh community, A&S students are expected to meet the obligation
to exhibit honesty and to respect the ethical standards of the
University community and of their chosen field of study in carrying
out academic assignments. A&S students are therefore expected to
familiarize themselves with the published rules and regulations go to
